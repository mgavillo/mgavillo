Hi ! I'm @mgavillo from 42 school.

I'm interested in a lot of stuff : crypto, web dev, design, electronics, AI and I try to fulfill all of these passions.  
I like making beautifull stuff, on the output part but also on the coding part.  
I'm currently a lot on web dev with React and trying to find my way in creative and interaction coding.  
Currently oppened to freelance, you can reach me on twitter (@swagy_marie) if you want to help me improve those skills and bring life to your ideas in the same time.
